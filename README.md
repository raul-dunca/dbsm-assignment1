## Problem Statement
Create a C# Windows Forms application that uses ADO.NET to interact with the database you developed in the 1st semester. The application must contain a form allowing the user to manipulate data in 2 tables that are in a 1:n relationship (parent table and child table). The application must provide the following functionalities:

* Display all the records in the parent table.
* Display the child records for a specific (i.e., selected) parent record.
* Add / remove / update child records for a specific parent record.
* Specifications for the functions related to point 3 above. 
* 10 complex numbers already available at program startup.

You must use the DataSet and SqlDataAdapter classes. You are free to use any controls on the form.
